Peter helped out with fixing some issues with connecting front/backend to correctly display. Namely that I was trying to reach a none existent result on the backend, so instead just pulled the raw data. And that I was stating that I needed the result as a JSON, but never actually functionalized it.

For the backend section you will find it located at here https://github.com/KenzieAcademy/django-rest-SeraphimSage/tree/Dev
